# etch-a-sketch

      In this project, I wrote a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is an Etch-a-Sketch application that runs in the browser. The user can draw on a canvas using the controls in the application's toolbar, change colors, and clear the canvas. Additionally, the user can change the size of the canvas, or grid, as desired.
